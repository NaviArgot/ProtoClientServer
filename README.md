# Prototype Game Server + Client

Hello this is a prototype game server I made in Lua, to use it you have to install Love2D on your computer and run the following commands inside this directory:

`love . --server`

This creates a server using loopback interface at port `9789`.

To create clients use this command:

`love .`

Now you will be able to use this thing  ദ്ദി ≽^⎚˕⎚^≼

## Oh I almost forgot:

- Press `[T]` to hide in game console.
- Press `[Esc]` to close the `PROGRAM`.
- Create more clients if you want more creatures existing in your game server.
